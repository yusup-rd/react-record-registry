## Project Overview

This React application is designed to manage user data through a simple user interface. The primary functionality of the application includes:

- **Input Form**: Users can input their name, age, subscription status, and employment status through a user-friendly form.

- **Data Storage**: The entered data is stored in local storage, allowing the application to retain the data even after the user refreshes or closes the application.

- **Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between dark and light modes for the application interface, providing a customized user experience.

- **Data Display**: The entered data is displayed in a table format, allowing users to view and select individual entries.

- **Deletion**: Users can delete previously entered data entries.

## Features

- **Input Form**: Users can input their name, age, subscription status, and employment status. The form includes various input elements such as text fields, a numeric input for age, a dropdown for subscription status, and a checkbox for employment status.

- **Data Display**: The entered data is displayed in a table with columns for name, age, subscription, and employment status. Users can click on a row to select and highlight it.

- **Data Storage**: The application uses local storage to persist the entered data even after the user closes or refreshes the application.

- **Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between dark and light modes for the application interface. The dark mode provides a visually appealing and comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions.

- **Deletion**: Users can delete selected data entries using the "Delete" button.
